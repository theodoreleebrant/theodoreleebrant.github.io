			Enter, stranger, but take heed
			of what awaits the sin of greed,
			For those who takem but do not earn,
			must pay most dearly in their turn.

			So if you seek beneath our floors
			A treasure that was never yours;
			thief, you have been warned, beware
			of finding more than treasure there.
